# GFN4Smileys

This is a project for exploring and benchmarking GFN in a toy use case.

## Project Outline
1. Define and implement sensible baselines for convergence rate
  1. Monte Carlo from target distribution
  2. Rejection Sampling
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling
  3. (Simple Metropolis-Hastings)
2. Compare convergence rates with GFN from Tutorial
3. (Try to improve GFN method)
